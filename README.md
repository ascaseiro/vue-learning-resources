CRUD app for managing learning resources made with Vue.js

This is an **educational project** made for hone my skills in [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org "Vue`s homepage") basics. The objective is to create an easy-to-use CRUD app for storing learning resources just using the tools that Vue.js has to offer. Please, remind that this is an only-Vue practice with no server, so there is no data persistance.

You can see how the app looks like in https://ascaseiro.github.io/vue-learning-resources/
